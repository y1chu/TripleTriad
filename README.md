## Rules of Triple Triad

Triple Triad is a card game played on a 3x3 grid. The goal of the game is to place your cards on the grid in such a way that you have the highest total value of cards on the board at the end of the game.

### Gameplay

1. Each player starts with a hand of five cards.
2. The first player places one of their cards on a square on the grid.
3. The second player then places one of their cards on an adjacent square.
4. Play continues back and forth until all squares on the grid are filled.
5. If a card is placed next to an opponent's card, and the value on the side of the card facing the opponent's card is higher, the opponent's card is captured and flipped to the player's color.
6. At the end of the game, the player with the most cards of their color on the board wins.

### Special Rules

There are several special rules that can come into play in Triple Triad:

- The "Same" rule states that if the card values on two adjacent cards are the same, they will both be captured.
- The "Plus" rule allows players to link cards together to create chains of captures.

### Card Values

Each card has a value on each of its four sides, and the values represent the strength of that card in battle against other cards. The higher the value, the stronger the card.
